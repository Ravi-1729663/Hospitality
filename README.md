# Hospitality Analytics Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project focuses on developing an **interactive Power BI dashboard** for analyzing key hospitality metrics such as **RevPAR, ADR, Occupancy %, SNR, DSRN, and Realization**. The dashboard provides actionable insights for hotel operations, helping to optimize pricing, reduce cancellations, and increase overall revenue and occupancy rates.

---

## Dashboard Features
- **Interactive Metrics Visualization:** Tracks key performance indicators (KPIs) such as revenue per available room (RevPAR), average daily rate (ADR), occupancy percentage, and realization rates.
- **Trend Analysis:** Compares weekday vs. weekend trends, highlighting patterns in **no-shows** and **cancellations**.
- **Data Integration:** Combines multiple data sources using **MySQL**, creating efficient and accurate data models.
- **Performance Insights:** Provides historical analysis to guide interventions, reducing cancellations and no-shows.
- **Revenue Optimization:** Uses data-driven pricing strategies to enhance weekend performance and maximize ADR and occupancy.
